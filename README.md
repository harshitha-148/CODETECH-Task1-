Overveiw of Project
Simple calculator
Objective
To develop a simple calculator using Python that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The goal is to enhance understanding of Python programming concepts like functions, user input, and error handling.

Key activities

Identify the operations the calculator should support (e.g., basic arithmetic).
Decide on the user interface (console-based or GUI).
Design and Planning:

Outline the program flow (e.g., user input, processing, and output).
Plan functions for each arithmetic operation.
Development:Write Python code using functions for each operation.

Technique used
Programming Language: Python
Development Environment: Any text editor or IDE (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code, Jupyter Notebook)
Libraries/Modules:
math (optional, for advanced functions like square roots or power operations)
tkinter (optional, if creating a GUI-based calculator)
